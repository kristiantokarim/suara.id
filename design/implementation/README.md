### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Indonesian-First Design**
- **Language Tiers**: Structured support for regional languages
- **Administrative Integration**: Built-in knowledge of Indonesian geography
- **Cultural Patterns**: UI/UX patterns familiar to Indonesian users
- **Trust Building**: Progressive verification respecting cultural norms

#### 2. **Mobile-First Architecture**
- **Progressive Web App**: App-like experience on mobile devices
- **Offline Support**: Works with poor connectivity
- **Touch Optimization**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Performance**: Optimized for 3G/4G networks

#### 3. **Anti-Abuse by Design**
- **Dual Scoring**: Trust (user) + Quality (submission) scoring
- **Progressive Access**: More features with higher trust levels
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate quality scoring during chat
- **Community Validation**: Peer endorsement system

#### 4. **Scalable Architecture**
- **Microservices Pattern**: Independent, deployable components
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries for Indonesian data patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching for performance
- **AI Integration**: Flexible LLM provider system
